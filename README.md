# Automated Plate Recognition 
 Automated Plate Recognition System (APRS) utilizing state-of-the-art AI techniques in image processing. The system was implemented using Python and the YOLO v8 object detection algorithm. The project involved training a model with a pre-existing dataset of vehicle plates and cars, followed by testing the model on a video. The outcomes, including data tables, graphics, and an output video, demonstrate the model's capabilities and limitations due to insufficient technical resources during training.
